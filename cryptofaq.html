                <h2>Cryptocurrency FAQ</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>

                <p>
                    Cryptocurrency is based on the idea of a decentralized public ledger system that is permissionless. What does
                    that mean? Central planning is largely based on the ideas of Neoclassical and Keynesian economics. Paul
                    Samuelson wrote The Principles of Economics in 1948. He favored the ideas of soviet/socialist central
                    planning rather than free market and continued to support these propositions all the way up until and even
                    after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He later edited his textbooks to remove his predictions and glaring
                    failed principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decentralization is based on the ideas of true democracy and free market. Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Finance is a
                    big step towards these powerful ideas. If central planning was a statistically proven science, then any math
                    genius would be able to completely game the stock market and financial system. This is obviously not the case.
                    Central planning is mostly pure political manipulation at the discretion of those that pull the levers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blockchain technology facilitates these public permissionless transactions to take place on a digital ledger
                    system that is authenticated, governed, and secured by an infinite number of nodes digitally. Each node must
                    follow all the prewritten digital contracts, or it can no longer participate on the network. These transactions
                    must meet all the consensus rules in order to be executed. A transaction can only be executed if it is verified
                    by all participating nodes as a legitimate transaction and reach a 100% digital consensus. If the transaction
                    is not able to be verified by all the nodes on the network, it is then kicked out of the system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This technology and idea suggest there is no need for a centralized "authority" or central planning to control
                    our currency by decree. There is no one person or central authority that can manipulate the currency for their own
                    selfish reasons. Inflation and counterfeit are two perfect examples of this. Since the invention of money people have
                    manipulated the production and scarcity of currency for their own benefit. There are many well-known and documented
                    examples throughout history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no perfect system, but decentralized finance and cryptocurrency has certainly made a major impact on how
                    we think about money and what other possibilities there might be. There are many different "cryptos" and evolving
                    mechanics that will build on this technology. As usage and adoption increases so will the security and reliability
                    of the networks involved. Crypto and Defi are truly revolutionary, and we are witnessing the next evolution in our
                    history. Many people can agree that a digital decentralized integrated system could be one of the most equitable
                    and fair solutions to some of our biggest problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe it is also important to ask whether you believe these new ideas or new technologies might not be well
                   -received by those who are able to freely manipulate our current system and profit from others ignorance?
                </p>

                <h3 class="borderbottom">What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>

                <p>
                    Cryptocurrency is a digital currency used in exchanges without the use of a bank, government or other centralized system.
                    This means there are no fees or taxes associated with its use. That feature is a draw to a lot of people.
                    They can use their money freely, and it keeps its value because it is being demonetized for example, by storing it in a bank (fees) or using it (taxes).
                </p>

                <p>All cryptocurrency transactions are stored in a ledger that records every transaction since the genesis of cryptocurrency.</p>

                <h3 class="borderbottom">What is the difference between cryptocurrency and a token?</h3>

                <p>A cryptocurrency coin is the digital version of underlying value, which might be debatable, whereas tokens carry the asset.</p>
                <p>Cryptocurrency is plural and may actually refer to more than one currency. Token is singular and refers to a single unity of some cryptocurrency.</p>
                <p>KonnektFi is a token.</p>


                <h3 class="borderbottom">What is blockchain technology?</h3>

                <p>
                    Turns out a blockchain isn't so mysterious. Technically, your hard disk is a blockchain, and every file on it is
                    DEFINITELY a blockchain. The thing that makes cryptocurrency blockchain special is the unspoken adjective "network-distributed"
                    before blockchain. Think of a file with its blocks scattered around the net, with a file system that knows where they are and
                    can reassemble them into a usable file.
                    That's almost it (that's actually more like a bit torrent). Now think of such a file that can be updated, and now we're getting somewhere.

                    Toss in some encryption to protect the nature of the activity, and now you have a blockchain!

                    Such a blockchain doesn't have to be used for finance, but the transactional nature of block structures pretty much implies
                    that it could be ideal, and it might just be ideal.

                    That's it! Like many such explanations it's a little oversimplified, but I hope it gives you a basic understanding of the data structure.

                <h3 class="borderbottom">Where do you use cryptocurrency?</h3>
                <p> I can use cryptocurrency in three places within a 5 mile radius from my house: a smoke shop, a major grocery store, 
                and an icehouse/cornerstore. Each place has a machine like an ATM where you can exchange cryptocurrency for cash and vice versa. 
                This is pretty typical, though by no means the only way.</p>
