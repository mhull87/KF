                    Our mission is to provide a better
                    alternative with a revolutionary business model that redistributes revenue created by, or on the
                    platform back to the users and holders of the governance token of our platform and DAO
                    (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). KNKT tokens will facilitate governance for, and total market
                    cap of our community, platform and mission. As with many markets, volume and market cap increase the
                    value of the main token. By holding and using the KNKT token, you now have the opportunity to benefit
                    as the value of the token increases. In addition, any other revenue that the platform and community
                    produce will also benefit holders directly. KNKT is also a governance token and will represent part
                    ownership of the DAO. Now ask yourself this, do you believe this is a better alternative to the
                    platforms you are currently using? There is a good chance that you are using social media in some form
                    or fashion but not being rewarded in anyway other than simply being given the access to konnekt with
                    and interact with the ones you love and others. Our mission is simple. We want to build a decentralized
                    platform where users enjoy a fimiliar social media app and actually benefit from the value that is
                    created in that space and ecosystem. Are you ready to Konnekt?
