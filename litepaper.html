                <br>
                <p>
                    KonnektFi is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that is building a superior social media
                    platform and a DeFi ecosystem that will protect user information and reward daily interactions. Our
                    social media app will function as a cryptocurrency wallet, transactionary medium, as well as an educational
                    tool. KonnektFi will DeFi better and facilitate mainstream adoption by providing a familiar platform!
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    We are building a decentralized platform that konnekts our personal, social, and financial wellbeing
                    all together in one app. We are revolutionizing how we think about social media and the role it plays in
                    our lives. We will redefine social media, redistribute value, create passive income, and monetize our daily
                    interactions!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is obvious that the largest tech companies profit from and understand the tremendous value of
                    relationships and community engagement. Traditional platforms primarily enrich a few executives and the
                    largest stockholders. KonnektFi is providing an ecosystem that will monetize and reward our daily engagements
                    with other users. After all, it is the users that create that value in the first place. WHY NOT join our mission
                    to empower and inspire one another, earn a passive income for doing the things that you are already doing, and
                    help achieve a worthy vision for the future? Existing conglomerates have amassed immense wealth by selling user
                    information, advertising revenue, and commerce that takes place on their platform. We are providing a better
                    alternative. We hope to educate the world about the benefits of defi and how that enables our app to monetize
                    our everyday interactions. KonnektFi is the gateway to unlock that potential.
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Tokenomics</h3>
                <p>
                    KNKT token is our main governance and utility token that will provide access to and governance for the ecosystem.
                    Holders and stakers will possess voting rights. Our token allocation serves to protect community interest, investor
                    security, and the ability to maintain a successful platform. We believe that community is the most important asset
                    and our token allocation reflects our commitment to that belief. We also believe it is more important to build and
                    maintain the best possible platform that will function properly and offer security which is why development and ops
                    is our main priority. A good product will market itself and is why our marketing allocation is lower than average.
                    As with any project it is also important to acknowledge the founders that have made this project possible and are
                    committed to the overall success of the whole community. We will conduct 1 presale to jumpstart momentum.
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Token Allocation</h3>
                <p>
                    60% Community<br />
                    15% Development and Operations<br />
                    10% Founders<br />
                    10% Presale<br />
                    04% Marketing<br />
                    01% Treasury
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Contract Address</h3>
                <p>TBD</p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">KNKT Token Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    KNKT is an erc-20 token that will be bridged at a later time to achieve the greatest interoperability
                    between the top networks. 50% of total supply will be released at launch. Every 3 months an amount voted
                    on by the community will be released into circulation until all tokens are in circulation.
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Tax Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    Operations and community will benefit the most from the buy and sell taxes. Our tax structure is
                    calibrated to support operational cost and successful longevity while still giving back to the community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    04% Development and Operations<br />
                    02% Liquidity<br />
                    02% Buyback<br />
                    02% Marketing
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Liquidity</h3>
                <p>Liquidity is essential for any ecosystem to thrive. Without liquidity the ecosystem is unable to grow.</p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Buybacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Buybacks will occur in intervals set by a community vote. Once these tokens have been paid for, they will
                    then be burned to reflect that value back to the holders and support price stability. The buyback and burn
                    function will serve to generate passive income for holders and stakers.
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Staking</h3>
                <p>
                    Staking is another way to generate even more passive income and will be paid in KNKT tokens. You may stake
                    your tokens for 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months. Each period will yield a different % of tokens for
                    that period. You can unstake your tokens at any time but will forfeit the reward for doing so. You may make
                    multiple, separate staking entries for different periods that will be independent of each other.
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Voting Structure</h3>
                <p>TBD</p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Limits</h3>
                <p>TBD</p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">Investor Protections</h3>
                <p>
                    The dev wallets will be secured through a multi sig protocol. Gnosis Safe is one of the top providers
                    for this feature. At least 4 out of 7 sig wallets must authorize any transactions that takes place from
                    the development and operations, marketing, or treasury wallets.
                </p>
                <h3 class="borderbottom">The App</h3>
                <p>
                    The KonnektFi app will be built and operated by Horizon Network LLC in order to provide operational and
                    legal protections for the community, platform, brand, and intellectual property. With legal protections in
                    place, we will be able to execute partnerships, merchandising, and sponsorship opportunities. Privacy, rights,
                    and content created by users will be owned by the user. Ownership and use of content are what will provide
                    the greatest reward for users, financial and otherwise. WEB 3.0 is based on digital ownership and that is
                    exactly what KonnektFi will provide and support. We are building social media 3.0!
