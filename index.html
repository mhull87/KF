                    We believe our vision for the future will empower and inspire the next evolution

        Contemporary social media services gather all of the relationships, activity,
        and other content produced by the users of their systems into vast, nuanced collections
        of information about each user on the system, with whom they interact, and upon what basis
        <em>for their fiduciary benefit</em>.
    </p>-->

                            <p>
                                We are building a decentralized platform that konnekts our personal, social, and financial well-being,
                                all together in one app. We are revolutionizing how we think about social media and the role it plays in
                                our lives. We will redefine social media, redistribute value, create passive income, and monetize our daily
                                interactions!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The largest tech companies profit from and understand the tremendous value of
                                relationships and community engagement. Traditional platforms primarily enrich a few executives and the
                                largest stockholders. KonnektFi provides an ecosystem that will monetize and reward our daily engagement
                                with other users. After all, it is the users who create that value in the first place. WHY NOT join our mission
                                to empower and inspire one another, earn a passive income for doing things you are already doing, and
                                help achieve a worthy vision for the future? Existing conglomerates have amassed immense wealth by selling user
                                information, advertising revenue, and commerce happening on their platform. We are providing a better
                                alternative. We hope to educate the world about the benefits of Defi and how that enables our app to monetize
                                our everyday interactions. KonnektFi is the gateway to unlock that potential.

                        <p>
                            The KNKT token is our main governance and utility token that will provide access to and governance for the ecosystem.
                            Holders and stakers will possess voting rights. Our token allocation serves to protect community interest, investor
                            security, and the ability to maintain a successful platform. We believe that community is the most important asset
                            and our token allocation reflects our commitment to that belief. We also believe it is more important to build and
                            maintain the best possible platform that will function properly and offer security which is why development and ops
                            are our main priority. A good product will market itself. That is why our marketing allocation is lower than average.
                            As with any project, it is important to acknowledge the founders that have made this project possible and are
                            committed to the overall success of the whole community. We will conduct one presale to jumpstart momentum.

                            KNKT is an ERC-20 token that will be bridged at a later time to achieve the greatest interoperability
                            between the top networks. 50% of the total supply will be released at launch. Every three months, an amount, voted
                            on by the community, will be released into circulation until all tokens are in circulation.

                            Buybacks will occur in intervals set by a community vote. Once these tokens have been paid for, they will
                            be burned to reflect that value to the holders and support price stability. The buyback and burn
                            function will serve to generate passive income for holders and stakers.

                        <h3>Staking</h3>
                        <p>
                            Staking is another way to generate even more passive income and is paid in KNKT tokens. You may stake
                            your tokens for one month, three months, six months, or 12 months. Each period will yield a different percentage of tokens for
                            that period. You can unstake your tokens at any time but will forfeit the reward for doing so. You may make
                            multiple, separate staking entries for different periods that will be independent of each other.

                        <p>
                            The dev wallets will be secured through a multi-sig protocol. Gnosis Safe is one of the top providers
                            of this feature. At least 4 out of 7 sig wallets must authorize any transactions that take place from
                            the development and operations, marketing, or treasury wallets.

                        <h3>The App</h3>
                        <p>
                            The KonnektFi app will be built and operated by Horizon Network LLC to provide operational and
                            legal protections for the community, platform, brand, and intellectual property. With legal protections in
                            place, we will be able to execute partnerships, merchandising, and sponsorship opportunities. Privacy, rights,
                            and content, created by users, will be owned by the user. Ownership and use of content will provide
                            the greatest reward for users, financial and otherwise. WEB 3.0 is based on digital ownership, which is
                            exactly what KonnektFi will provide and support. We are building social media 3.0!
                        </p>

                        At KonnektFi, we think that the time has come for us as users not just to take our data
                        back into our possession, but to continue that advance and reserve those benefits, financial
                        and otherwise, to ourselves.
