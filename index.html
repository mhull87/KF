                                create by simply engaging in these spaces. Our vision is simple. We are building a

                                Cryptocurrency is the fastest-growing asset class in human history with a 2.15 trillion-dollar
                                market cap as of March 29, 2022. We are building a crypto-related ecosystem and pairing it with a
                                familiar platform. “The global social media market is expected to grow from $159.68 billion in 2021
                                to $223.11 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth of 39.7%”, per a Yahoo Finance report on
                                March 8, 2022.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I would encourage you to ask yourself the following two questions:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>“Why is the social media industry so valuable and yet free to use?”</li>
                                <li>“Who <em>really</em> benefits the most from the massive wealth and commerce created on traditional platforms?”</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                It is obvious that the largest tech companies profit from and understand the tremendous
                                value of relationships and community engagement. Traditional platforms primarily enrich a
                                few executives and the largest stockholders. Existing conglomerates have amassed immense
                                wealth through advertising revenue, commerce and even selling user information. We are
                                providing a better alternative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                KonnektFi will benefit users and creators unlike any other platform that currently exists.

                <p>
                    Our decentralized ecosystem will redistribute revenue created by, or on, the platform through the KNKT token.
                    KNKT is the main governance and utility token for the community, by the community. KNKT will have several
                    functions. Users will be able to buy, sell, trade, or send KNKT to one another, as well as send them to any
                    other wallet, platform, or network that supports the token.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The purpose of a DAO is it is a community-driven and operated entity. The success, operation, and
                            direction of the DAO is entirely dependent on the community. Holders of KNKT enjoy part ownership and
                            governance of the KonnektFi ecosystem.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            KNKT is also utilized as a transactionary tool that holds monetary value. The community will be able to
                            buy, sell, trade, or send the tokens on or off the platform as well as to each other. As with any currency,
                            monetary value (price) will vary depending on several factors such as, supply and demand, circulating supply,
                            and market cap, to name a few. Our tokenomics are set in such a way, that KNKT will have the
                            characteristics of a deflationary token which helps stabilize the price or even increase the value of current
                            tokens in circulation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            KNKT is purchaseable by entities outside of the ecosystem in order to do business with
                            or interact with our platform and community. Utilizing our token will allow for that revenue to be
                            redistributed to the community, in effect creating a passive income for holders. As the community and holders
                            increase, volume and market cap also increase. You could imagine that the KonnektFi app, with millions of users,
                            could be just as valuable as any traditional platform but with one major difference! The holders of KNKT will
                            benefit the most! By holding KNKT, transacting with one another, buying, selling, and trading on our platform,
                            each user is contributing to the value and market cap of the whole ecosystem.
                        </li>

                                rights. Our token allocation serves to protect community interest, investor

                                commitment to that belief. We will build and maintain the best possible platform

                                are committed to the overall success of the whole community. We are very
                                excited to say that our token allocation reflects these important values and will

                                KNKT is an ERC-20 token that will be bridged at a later time to achieve the greatest interoperability
                                between the top networks. TBD% of the total supply will be released at launch. Every three months, an amount, voted
                                on by the community, will be released into circulation until all tokens are in circulation.

                                Buybacks will occur in intervals set by a community vote. Once these tokens have been paid for, they will
                                be burned to reflect that value to the holders and support price stability. The buyback and burn
                                function will serve to generate passive income for holders and stakers.

                                Staking is another way to generate even more passive income and is paid in KNKT tokens. You may stake
                                your tokens for one month, three months, six months, or 12 months. Each period will yield a different percentage of tokens for
                                that period. You can unstake your tokens at any time but will forfeit the reward for doing so. You may make
                                multiple, separate staking entries for different periods that will be independent of each other.
